An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res),
and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

Route is a section of Express code that associates an HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), 
a URL path/pattern, and a function that is called to handle that pattern.
